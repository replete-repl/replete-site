# Replete SDK

Replete includes several namespaces adhering fairly closely to existing 
Clojure / ClojureScript analogs. An overview is presented in the 
[Replete Namespaces](replete-namespaces.html) portion of the guide and
full documentation is enumerated in the sections here:

* [replete.core](replete-core.html)
* [replete.io](replete-io.html)
* [replete.http](replete-http.html)

Additionally, Replete bundles [most of the Google Closure Library](gcl.html).
