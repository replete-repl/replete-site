Replete is a ClojureScript REPL for iOS and Android.

Replete launches instantly, providing a full-featured REPL environment that is great for experimenting with and learning the ClojureScript language.

All form evaluation in Replete is done directly on the device. (Replete does not delegate to a back-end server for compilation and evaluation.)
